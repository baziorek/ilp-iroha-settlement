# Examples

Here you can find various examples of `ilp-iroha-settlement`'s functionality:
- setup ILP accounts within the settlement engine and exchange ledger identifiers

### Prerequisites

The required setup is powered by the `docker-compose.yml` file, which sets up Iroha networks, ILP nodes and settlement engines all within a single docker network. Start it up with `docker-compose up`.

In order to be able to run the example scripts, you must have `ilp-cli` installed (you can find instructions for downloading it [here](https://github.com/interledger-rs/interledger-rs)) and available.
